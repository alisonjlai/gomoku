AI (ComputerPlayer Class)

1. Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something more clever than just pick a random legal move?
Yes, I implemented a heuristic evaluation function.
The goal was to make the computer player more intelligent than randomly choosing moves.

2. If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as you would like?
The program implements a heuristic evaluation function considering patterns, threats, and defensive moves, which are given different weights for consideration.
The empty spot with the highest evaluation score (best score) will be chosen by the computer player to place a white stone (best move).

For patterns: the function is designed to give a higher score to the empty spot if there are 2 or 3 or more stones of the same color neighboring it (higher chance of winning/losing if not placed there).
For threats: check if there's a winning move of the black stone player
For defensive move: check for computer's potential winning moves

*Specifically, it'll prioritize its own winning move if there's one (score --> infinite) over anything else.

3. How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm
Answered in 2.

4. How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it out for you?
Quite often, especially if the human player is not careful enough.

5. How easy would it be to make the difficulty level adjustable?
I'll try modifying the weights assigned to different factors in the heuristic evaluation function to make it more or less aggressive in certain aspects. 

6. How would you improve it in the future?
Would try to make it create traps/create some patterns that produce two winning moves at the same time, so no matter what, the player will lose.
